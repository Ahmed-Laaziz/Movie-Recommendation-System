## Project Overview
Our project utilized the MovieLens dataset and leveraged the power of Python for data cleaning, preparation, and processing. With this rich dataset, we aimed to deliver a user-friendly movie recommendation experience to our users.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: We used Python for data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis, making sure our recommendations are accurate and tailored to individual preferences.

- **Neo4j**: The project took advantage of Neo4j, a graph-oriented database, to efficiently manage and analyze the complex relationships between movies and user preferences.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python dependencies.
3. Set up Neo4j and import the movie data.
4. Run the application and start exploring personalized movie recommendations!

## Acknowledgments
We extend our sincere gratitude to Mr. Mohamed Hanine for his invaluable guidance, expertise, and unwavering support throughout this project. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and we couldn't have achieved this without your mentorship.
